# Set Game Implementation in C++

This repository contains a console-based implementation of the popular board game "Set" written in C++.

## Overview

"Set" is a card game where players identify sets of three cards based on certain characteristics, such as color, shape, number, and shading. A set consists of three cards in which each feature is either all the same or all different. 

## Files

- **main.cpp**: Contains the main logic for running the game.
- **Card.h** and **Card.cpp**: Define the Card class representing each card in the game.
- **functions.h** and **functions.cpp**: Declare and implement various helper functions used in the game, such as shuffling the deck and checking for sets.
  
## How to Run

To compile and run the game, you can use any C++ compiler that supports C++11 or higher standards. For example, you can use g++ on Linux or MinGW on Windows.
